Each article is associated with the user who created it and a unique identifier is assigned to it for database management.

Users can view a list of all the articles on the blog Home page.
Articles are displayed with the title, category, tags, and the number of comments.

### 4. Edit/Delete Articles

Editing an article updates its title, content, categories, and tags.
Deleting an article also deletes all the comments associated with it.

### 5. Categories, Tags, and Filters

Users can add categories and tags to their articles for better organization and searchability.
The blog page has filter options to display articles by category or tag.
Users can also search for articles using keywords.

### 6. Comments

Users can add comments to articles.
Each comment is associated with the user who posted it and the article it is posted on.
The total number of comments for each article is displayed on the blog page.

### 7. MongoDB Database

MongoDB is used as the backend database to store user information, articles, and comments.
Articles and comments are stored in separate collections, and the user collection is linked to them.
Data is accessed and manipulated using MongoDB's official Node.js driver and Mongoose.js, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
